This repo is about our my current notes about different computer sciences topics and fields as well as a practice how to use git, github, and version control.
The main tool will be through Visual Studio Code.

I may include some ideas, comments or conclusions about my experience. Some references and others sites will be included as needed.
 
This repo will be updated constantly in order to increase or correct some older ideas.
